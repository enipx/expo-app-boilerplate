# Expo App Boilerplate Template

This boilerplate provides you with a quick foundation for developing Expo apps with Expo Router, ESLint, and Redux toolkit pre-configured. It is designed to jumpstart your development process, allowing you to focus on building your app's unique features without the hassle of setting up these essential tools from scratch.

## Features

**Expo Router**: The template comes with Expo Router, which simplifies navigation and provides a seamless user experience within your app.

**ESLint**: ESLint is configured with recommended rules to ensure consistent code quality and adherence to best practices throughout your project.

**Redux Toolkit**: Redux is integrated, allowing you to manage your app's state efficiently and implement a scalable and maintainable architecture.

## Getting Started

To use this boilerplate template, follow these simple steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone <https://github.com/enipx/expo-app-boilerplate>.

Install the project dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.

Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`. This will launch your Expo app in the development mode.

## Folder Structure

The boilerplate template follows a well-organized folder structure to keep your codebase clean and maintainable:

``` lua
|-- app
|-- assets
|-- components
|-- constants
|-- helpers
|-- hooks
|-- redux
|-- ...
```

**app**: Place your app screens here, organized by functionality.

**assets**: Store your static assets like images, fonts, etc.

**components**: Reusable UI components go here.

**constants**: Place constant files or data here.

**helpers**: Helpers methods goes here

**hooks**: Add your hooks here
